### What We Built in the Script

Our `script.py` implements a comprehensive Machine Learning pipeline for customer churn prediction with the following key components:

#### üîß **Custom Transformers**
- **DataFrameSelector**: Custom transformer for selecting specific columns in sklearn pipelines
- **OutlierHandler**: IQR-based outlier detection and clipping transformer

#### üìä **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**
- **Numerical Features**: Median imputation ‚Üí Outlier handling ‚Üí Robust scaling
- **Categorical Features**: Mode imputation ‚Üí One-hot encoding
- **Ready Features**: Simple imputation for binary/numeric ready-to-use features

#### ‚öñÔ∏è **Class Imbalance Handling**
- **Method 1**: No imbalance handling (baseline)
- **Method 2**: Class weights (inverse frequency weighting)
- **Method 3**: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

#### ü§ñ **Model Training & Evaluation**
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression with different imbalance strategies
- **Metrics**: F1-score for training and validation sets
- **Visualization**: Confusion matrices for each approach
- **Output**: Combined confusion matrix plot and detailed metrics file

#### üìà **Results & Comparison**
- Automated comparison of three different approaches to handle class imbalance
- Visual confusion matrices saved as PNG files
- Comprehensive metrics logging to `metrics.txt`
- Clean, organized output with automatic file cleanup

The script demonstrates best practices in MLOps including modular code design, proper preprocessing pipelines, and comprehensive model evaluation.
